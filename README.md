#  Introduce DissectLaravel doc
There's tons of laravel documentation all over the place, it floods every web page and every discussion. However, I did not find any document that is deep and extensive enough, the knowledge system of laravel. As you know, from a technical perspective, when you read the doc and use it, you partially understand it. But you really get insight when you read the source code, understand how it's implemented, how it's designed. The source code will provide and reflect the software as it is, pure and straightforward. This is the most in-depth and intuitive approach to opensource. Of course it is not easy and takes a lot of resources. When you understand the source code, you will learn a lot from that opensource, you will debug problems very quickly without finding answers or unclear. You have a systematic thinking about the product, able to solve and fix very difficult bugs. This document provides a general analysis of the theory, the keyword laravel implementation, it is the most general, it is true for web technology in general, regardless of the language. I will try to analyze the laravel source code on the mind of web technology these days. I believe it is a useful reference for web developers, as well as devops who want an overview of the web app system.

# Who need doc
This document is for anyone passionate about web app, passionate about php, laravel for all level. If you don't like php, approach it by keyword, but if you love php, enjoy and relax with it. Hope it brings value and helps someone improves level, or simply solve your problem.
